"I have a basic market square simulation game built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (code provided below). The game lets players design and manage a market by placing stalls, shops, restaurants, and entertainment areas on a 10x10 grid, while balancing money, customer satisfaction, vendor happiness, and cleanliness. Random events like festivals and theft also affect gameplay. Currently, the UI uses simple colored blocks (e.g., orange for stalls, blue for shops) and basic text for resources and events.
I’d like you to enhance the game by adding charming, colorful art and improving the UI to make it more engaging and visually appealing, evoking the vibrancy of a real-world marketplace. Specifically:
Art Assets: Replace the colored blocks in the grid with simple, marketplace-themed icons or sprites (e.g., a tent for stalls, a storefront for shops, a food cart for restaurants, a stage for entertainment). You can use free SVG icons, CSS-drawn shapes, or suggest placeholder images I can source.
UI Polish: Redesign the resource display (money, satisfaction, etc.) and control buttons with a cohesive, lively theme—think bright colors, rounded edges, and a hand-drawn or whimsical feel. Add hover effects or animations (e.g., buttons pulse slightly).
Engagement Features: Add visual feedback to make the game more interactive, such as:
A subtle animation when a building is placed (e.g., it fades in or pops up).
Event notifications with icons (e.g., a confetti burst for festivals, a theft icon for losses).
A background image or pattern for the grid to resemble a cobblestone plaza or market ground.
Scalability: Ensure the art and UI changes are modular so I can easily swap in new assets or tweak styles later.
Please modify my existing code to incorporate these improvements. If you need external assets, suggest where I can find free, marketplace-themed SVGs or sprites (e.g., OpenGameArt, Flaticon). Keep the core gameplay mechanics intact—focus on the visual and engagement upgrades. Here’s my current code:"
